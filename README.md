I am learning Git workflows including branching, pull requests, and collaborative development through creating a digital zine about time travel concepts.

We ignore `.DS_Store` (macOS system files) and `*.swp` (editor swap files) because these are system-generated files that differ across machines and clutter the repository. Including them would cause unnecessary merge conflicts and bloat the version history.
